## User Guide

A user guide is provided in the website for organizers. Creating a team leaderboard for the contest is simple and consists of small steps which the organizer must perform.

The organizer must fill a form with the details of the contest, which includes the contest-slug, problem-slugs of all the problems and the link for a JSON file containing a mapping between the teamnames and the HackerRank usernames of the team members. Upon filling the form, a link can be generated which provides a leaderboard for the contest.
